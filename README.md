# README for To-Do List App

This is a simple To-Do List App built using React. The app allows users to add, edit, complete, and delete tasks from a list. The tasks are saved to local storage, so they will persist even after the browser is closed.

## Usage

To add a task, type the task into the input field and click the "Add" button. To edit a task, click the "edit" button next to the task, make your changes, and click the "Ok" button. To complete a task, click the "complete" button next to the task. To delete a task, click the "delete" button next to the task.
